# Analytics Collection

Analytics collection stores the raw output of enabled metrics-utility collectors
in `AnalyticsPayload`. The stored row is a collection envelope: collector name,
source, collection bounds, collection timestamps, and the raw JSON payload.

The read and trigger APIs are available under `/api/v1/analytics/` and are
restricted to users with the System Administrator or Platform Auditor role.

## Collector Registry

The registry is the source of truth in
[`apps/analytics/registry.py`](../apps/analytics/registry.py). Each entry has:

- `name`: public/API/storage name, in `group.function` form
- `collector_type`: internal task registry key
- `mode`: `hourly`, `daily`, or `snapshot`
- `enabled`: whether the collector is persisted and exposed
- `database`: source database, defaulting to `awx`
- `description`: customer-facing summary of the data returned by the collector
- `note`: explanation for disabled or excluded entries

`accepts_since_until` is derived from `mode`. It describes whether the collector
can receive `since` and `until` bounds; it does not require both bounds to be
present.

## Enabled Collectors

All enabled collectors are persisted and exposed by the read API. Except for
`controller.query_info`, which reports collection metadata, these collectors
read from the Controller (`awx`) database.

## Disabled And Excluded Collectors

These entries remain in the registry so their status and reason are visible to
developers. They are not persisted or exposed by the analytics API.

## Read API

The analytics root lists enabled collectors and links to their row and collection-task endpoints:

```http
GET /api/v1/analytics/
```

The response contains entries such as:

```json
{
  "collectors": [
    {
      "name": "controller.config",
      "description": "Selected Controller settings and license details, plus Controller and metrics-utility versions and runtime platform metadata.",
      "mode": "snapshot",
      "accepts_since_until": false,
      "rows_url": "https://metrics.example.com/api/v1/analytics/controller.config/",
      "collect_url": "https://metrics.example.com/api/v1/analytics/controller.config/collect/"
    }
  ]
}
```

The collector endpoint returns paginated collection envelopes:

```http
GET /api/v1/analytics/controller.unified_jobs_dashboard/
```

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "next": null,
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "collector": "controller.unified_jobs_dashboard",
      "source": "local",
      "since": "2026-08-17T10:00:00Z",
      "until": "2026-08-17T11:00:00Z",
      "started_at": "2026-08-17T11:01:02Z",
      "finished_at": "2026-08-17T11:01:08Z",
      "payload": [
        {"id": 100, "status": "successful"},
        {"id": 101, "status": "failed"}
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The actual list response includes `count`, `next`, `previous`, and `results`.
Use `page` and `page_size` for pagination. `count_disabled=true` can omit the
count and navigation links when supported by the paginator.

### Window Filters

Filtering uses half-open interval overlap. A stored row matches a query when:

```text
stored_until IS NULL OR stored_until > query_since
stored_since IS NULL OR stored_since < query_until
```

The comparisons are applied only when the corresponding query bound is present.
Therefore:

- No query bounds returns every collection for the collector, newest first.
- `?since=2026-08-17T11:00:00Z` means `[11:00, +infinity)`.
- `?until=2026-08-17T11:00:00Z` means `(-infinity, 11:00)`.
- Both bounds filter the requested `[since, until)` interval.
- Invalid timestamps and `until <= since` return `400`.

Examples:

| Stored row | Query | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `[10:00, 11:00)` | `[10:00, 11:00)` | match |
| `[10:00, 11:00)` | `[11:00, 12:00)` | no match |
| `[09:00, 10:00)` | `[10:00, 11:00)` | no match |
| `[10:00, infinity)` | `(-infinity, 11:00)` | match |
| `(-infinity, 11:00)` | `[11:00, 12:00)` | no match |
| `[null, null]` | any valid query | match |

Every successful collection is retained in the raw payload store. Claim records are
separate coordination records; pending and failed claims are never exposed as
completed analytics rows.

### Triggering Collection

The collector trigger resolves the requested window and atomically creates a
coordination claim plus a normal pending `Task`. It does not execute the collector
in the web request or create a payload row. The scheduler discovers and dispatches
the task through the normal task machinery.

```http
POST /api/v1/analytics/controller.config/collect/
```

For a snapshot, an empty JSON body uses the collector defaults:

```json
{}
```

New and in-progress work returns `202 Accepted`. The response includes `claim_id`,
`state`, `task_id`, `task_url`, `collector`, `task_data`, `payload_id`, and
`reused`. The claim state is `pending`, `running`, `completed`, or `failed`.
An identical request reuses the existing task and claim instead of creating
another task. A completed claim returns `200 OK` with its stored `payload_id`.

Failed claims are retried by a later identical trigger with a new pending task.
Pending or running claims older than the configured
`ANALYTICS_ON_DEMAND_CLAIM_STALE_AFTER` interval are treated as orphaned and
recovered with a new task. This timeout is a recovery boundary, not a guarantee
that a worker which is still alive will be stopped; callers should use the task
and claim state for operational visibility.

Window-capable collectors accept no bound, one bound, or both bounds. A missing
key receives the normal hourly or daily default; an explicit JSON `null` leaves
that bound open. Thus `{}` fills both defaults, `{"since": null}` fills only
the default `until`, and `{"since": null, "until": null}` is unbounded.
Invalid timestamps and reversed complete ranges return `400`.
Collection tasks always use the
storage default source, `local`; source selection is not part of the task or POST
contract.

## Creating Collection Tasks

Tasks are created through `POST /api/v1/tasks/`. The task API accepts
`function_name`, JSON `task_data`, optional `scheduled_time`, and optional
`cron_expression`. Immediate tasks omit both scheduling fields. The scheduler
submits immediate tasks during its periodic sync; recurring task rows create a
new child task on each cron fire.

### One Snapshot With Defaults

For a snapshot, only the public collector name is needed:

```http
POST /api/v1/tasks/
```

```json
{
  "name": "analytics-config-once",
  "function_name": "collect_analytics_on_demand",
  "task_data": {
    "collector": "controller.config"
  },
  "scheduled_time": null,
  "cron_expression": null
}
```

The task uses the collector's default behavior. A snapshot receives no
`since`/`until` bounds.

### Recurring Cron Tasks

Use the dedicated recurring-task endpoint for recurring collection:

```http
POST /api/v1/tasks/schedule_recurring/
```

Recurring tasks must use the mode-specific collection function. The scheduler
uses the function name to inject the rolling default window at dispatch time:

| Mode | `function_name` | `task_data` | Default collection |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hourly | `collect_hourly_metrics` | `collector_type` | Previous full hour |
| Daily | `collect_daily_metrics` | `collector_type` | Previous calendar day |
| Snapshot | `collect_snapshot_metrics` | `collector_type` | Current state, no window |

For example, a daily recurring task is:

```json
{
  "name": "analytics-main-host-daily",
  "function_name": "collect_daily_metrics",
  "task_data": {
    "collector_type": "main_host_daily"
  },
  "cron_expression": "0 2 * * *"
}
```

Do not use `collect_analytics_on_demand` for a recurring hourly or daily task
when the rolling default window is wanted. Without explicit bounds, that
function passes an unbounded window to hourly/daily collectors; the scheduler's
default-window injection applies to the three mode-specific functions above.

The response contains a success message and `task_id`. The recurring row is a
template. Each cron fire creates a non-recurring child task, which is then
dispatched normally. One-off collections, including custom hourly or daily
windows, use `collect_analytics_on_demand` through the analytics trigger
endpoint described above.

### Custom Window Task

For a specific collection window, pass ISO timestamps in `task_data`:

```json
{
  "name": "analytics-unified-jobs-hour",
  "function_name": "collect_analytics_on_demand",
  "task_data": {
    "collector": "controller.unified_jobs_dashboard",
    "since": "2026-08-17T10:00:00Z",
    "until": "2026-08-17T11:00:00Z"
  },
  "scheduled_time": null,
  "cron_expression": null
}
```

The trigger POST maps directly to the same task data: a snapshot POST with no
body creates the name-only task, while a request body containing `since` and
`until` creates the custom-window task. The analytics trigger is the safe
on-demand entry point. Direct task creation is still supported for internal use,
but it does not create an HTTP claim unless it originates from the trigger.
Scheduled collector persistence remains separate from on-demand claim coordination.
