    Clean up old completed and failed tasks from the database.

    This task removes tasks that have been completed or failed for more than
    the specified number of days. This helps maintain database performance
    and prevents unlimited growth of task history.

    IMPORTANT: Recurring tasks are automatically preserved and will NOT be deleted,
    regardless of their age, to ensure scheduled tasks continue to function.

    Args:
        **kwargs: Task data containing cleanup parameters:
            - days_old (int): Number of days old tasks should be to qualify for cleanup (default: 5)
            - dry_run (bool): If True, only count tasks that would be deleted (default: False)
            - include_executions (bool): Also cleanup related TaskExecution records (default: True)
            - preserve_recurring (bool): If True, exclude recurring tasks from cleanup (default: True)

    Returns:
        dict: Task result dictionary with cleanup statistics
